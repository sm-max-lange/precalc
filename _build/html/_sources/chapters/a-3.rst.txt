Polynomials and Power Functions (Chapter 11)
==================================================

Power Functions
----------------

.. rubric:: Power Function form


.. math::

    f(x) = kx^p


k and p are constants.

.. rubric:: Example of Power Function

.. math::

    f(x) = 2 \sqrt[3]{x}

p: :math:`\frac{1}{3}`
k: :math:`2`


.. rubric:: Example of Not a Power Function

.. math::

    f(x) = (x-2)^2

Not a power function due to multiple x values when expanded

.. rubric:: Direct and Inverse Proportional 

| If f(x) is directly proportional to :math:`x^p` if :math:`f(x) = kx^p`
| If f(x) is inverse proportional to :math:`x^p` if :math:`f(x) = \frac{k}{x^p}`

.. todo::

    Make some example questions

.. rubric:: Graphs of Power Functions

The graph is based off of the k an p. The following is based off p is a non negative integer.

Limit Notations
------------------

A limit is is what a function approaches as x approaches a.

.. math::

    \displaystyle{\lim_{x \to a}} f(x)


For example:

.. math::

    \displaystyle{\lim_{x \to \infty}} f(x) = 9

This states that x increases without bonds as f(x) approaches 9.

.. rubric:: Left, Right Approach

.. todo::

    Left right limit stuff



Polynomials
------------------

| A **polynomial** is an equation where are terms consist of a constants coefficient to a variable which is raised to a positive integer.
| A **leading term** is the term that contains the largest exponent.
| The **degree** is the largest exponent.

.. note::

    Polynomials are usually written from highest power to lowest power.


.. rubric:: Example of Polynomial

.. math::

    f(x) = 13x^4 - 8x^2 + 4x - 9

| Degree: :math:`4`
| Leading coefficient: :math:`13`
| Leading term: :math:`13x^4`

.. rubric:: Example of non Polynomial

.. math::

    f(x) = 12x^2 + \sqrt[5]{x}

:math:`\sqrt[5]{x}` is the same as :math:`x^{\frac{1}{5}}` and since polynomials must have a positive *integer* exponent, this is not a polynomial.

.. rubric:: Long Run of a Single Polynomial

The long run of polynomial always represents its leading coefficient.

Example:

.. math::

    f(x) = 9x^3 -4x^2 + 2

While it may act differently in the short run, the graph will act like :math:`9x^3` in the long run.

Since :math:`9x^3` has a domain of :math:`[-infty, \infty]`, the :math:`9x^3 -4x^2 + 2` will have the same **long run** domain.

Multiplicity effect of Zeros
------------------------------

The factored form, the **multiplicity** is the degree that a zero is raised by. For example in :math:`(x - 2)^4`, the multiplicity will be 4.

| If the multiplicity is one, the graph will pass straight though the x-axis.
|  If the multiplicity is odd (but not one), the graph will pass straight though the x-axis, but appear to be flattened.
|  If the multiplicity is even, the graph will bounce on the x-axis

Finding Zeros for degree > 2 (RZT)
-----------------------------------


**RZT** states that if a polynomial has integer coefficients, the every rational zero has the form :math:`\mp \frac{Factor of Constant}{Factor of Leading Term}`

.. note::

    A function of n power will have at most n-1 zeros!

.. tip::

    To forget to try grouping!!!

#. Factor completely
#. Apply RZT to find all possible zeros
#. Use a graphing calculator to find most likely zeros
#. Use long division and divide the equation by the zero form. :math:`(x - k)` where k is the zero.

    * If the zero bounces, known that the multiplicity is two and you must divide twice.
    * If the zero passes, known that the multiplicity is one and you must divide once.

#. Repeat until the equation is factorable or able to solve via quadratic formula.

Complex Zeros
----------------------------

| The **conjugate pair theorem** states that if :math:`a + bi` is a zero, then :math:`a - bi` is also a zero. For example, if :math:`7 - 4i` is a zero, so is :math:`7 + 4i`

To express the zeros in a formula know that :math:`a + bi` will become :math:`x-(a+bi)`
#. Multiply the two complex zeros

    .. math::
    
        (x - (a + bi))(x - (a - bi))
        ((x - a) + bi)((x - a) - bi)
        (x-a)^2 - (bi)^2
        x^2 -2ax + a^2 + b^2

#. Long divide the equation by zero, result will be remaining zero
