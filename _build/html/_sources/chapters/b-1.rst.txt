Trigonometry
==============

Unit Circle
------------

A unit circle has a radius of 1.

.. rubric:: Measuring Position on a Circle Using Angles

* The positive x-axis forms the **terminal side**
* Positive angeles are measured counter-clockwise from **terminal side**
* Angles greater than one rotation (:math:`360\deg` or :math:`2\pi`) will warp around
    * Two angeles that that start and end in the same place are **co-terminal**. 
        * Ex. :math:`45\deg` is co-terminal to :math:`405\deg`
* The **reference angle** is the shortest distance from the x-axis


.. drawio-image:: imgt/basic-circle-reference.drawio


This image shows two co-terminal angeles `45\deg` and :math:`405\deg` with a reference angle of `45\deg`.

.. tip::

    The denominator of a radian will give its reference angle 

    :math:`\frac{11\pi}{6}` has a reference of :math:`\frac{\pi}{6}`

.. rubric:: Finding sine, cosine, and tangent with the unit circle

The unit circle has a radius of one. The means a right triangle can be formed and the 45/45/90 and 30/60/90 triangles can be used.

| In a unit circle the x cords represent the cosine values
| The y cords represent the sine values
| Tangent is :math:`\frac{sin(\theta)}{cos(\theta)}`

Unit circle:

.. image:: imgt/unit-circle.png

Using reference angles, it is possible to find all quadrants based on quadrant I. For example both :math:`30\deg` and :math:`150\deg` have a reference angle of :math:`30\deg` so the sine value is :math:`\frac{1}{2}`

| In quadrant I and quadrant II sine values are the same. In quadrant III and quadrant IV sine values are the negative.
| In quadrant I and quadrant IV cosine values are the same. In quadrant II and quadrant III cosine values are the negative.


Example Question:

What is :math:`sin(210)`?

First the reference angle can be found. 

.. math::

    210 - 180 &= 30 \\
    sin(30) &= |sin(210)| \\
    |sin(210)|  &= \frac{1}{2} \\
    
Since sine (y) is negative in quadrant III, :math:`sin(210) = -\frac{1}{2}` 


Reciprocal Functions
-------------------------

Reciprocal functions are the reciprocal of the trigonometric functions.

Reciprocal functions:

.. math::

    secant &= sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{sin(\theta)} \\
    cosecant &= cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{cos(\theta)} \\
    cotangent &= cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{tan(\theta)}

.. rubric:: Reciprocal functions Algebra

Trig functions can often be simplified.

Example:

.. math::

    & csc(\theta) \cdot sin(theta) \\
    &= \frac{1}{sin(\theta)} \cdot \frac{sin(\theta)}{1} \\
    &= 1

This simplifies down to 1

Pythagorean Identities
-----------------------------

* :math:`sin^2(\theta) + cos^2(\theta) = 1`
* :math:`1 + tan^2(\theta) = sec^2(\theta)`
    * Formed by dividing original by :math:`cos^2(\theta)`
* :math:`1 + cot^2(\theta) = csc^2(\theta)`
    * Formed by dividing original by :math:`sin^2(\theta)`

.. rubric:: Example

If :math:`sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{3}`, :math:`what is sec(\theta)`?

.. math::

    (\frac{1}{3})^2 + cos^2(\theta) &= 1 \\
    \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{9}} &= cos(\theta) \\
    cos(\theta) &= \frac{2 \sqrt{2}}{3} \\
    sec(\theta) &= \frac{3}{2 \sqrt{2}} \\
    sec(\theta) &= \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{4}


Periodic Functions
-------------------

| A **periodic** function values repeat on a constant interval.
| The **period of a function** is the length of a function before it repeats.

Sine and cosine have a period of :math:`2\pi` or :math:`360 \deg`. This is one full rotation on the unit circle, after this the values repeat.

The reciprocal functions have the same period as their non reciprocals.

.. image:: imgt/sine-cosine-periods.png


Even Odd Symmetry
------------------

* The cosine function is even meaning that :math:`cos(-\theta) = cos(\theta)`
* The sine function is odd meaning that :math:`sin(-\theta) = -sin(\theta)`
* The tangent function is odd meaning that :math:`tan(-\theta) = -tan(\theta)`

This can be helpful when dealing with negative angles. Rather use even odd properties.

Parent Graphs
---------------

| A **midline** is the middle of the wave and equaldistant from the maximum and minimum.
| **Amplitude** is a positive number of how far the maximum/minimum is from the midline.

.. rubric:: Sine

.. math::

    y = sin(x)


* Sine has a midline at :math:`y=0` and has an amplitude of 1.
* Sine has a period of :math:`2 \pi`
* Sine starts at the midline and increases til maximum then decreases to minimum passing though midline and increases to midline.

.. image:: imgt/sine.png

.. rubric:: Cosine

.. math::

    y = sin(x)


* Cosine has a midline at :math:`y=0` and has an amplitude of 1.
* Cosine has a period of :math:`2 \pi`
* Cosine starts at the maximum and decreases to minimum passing though midline and increases to maximum passing though midline.

.. image:: imgt/cosine.png

Transformations
---------------------

.. rubric:: Shifting midline

To shift the midline upward, shift the function upward. 

:math:`y = sin(x) + k` will shift the function up by k and make the midline :math:`y = k`

Example:

.. image:: imgt/vshift-cosine.png

.. rubric:: Changing Amplitude

To change to the amplitude, multiply the outside of the function by the new amplitude.

:math:`y = A cos(x)` will have an amplitude of A

Example:

.. image:: imgt/amp-sine.png

.. rubric:: Shifting Horizontal

To shift horizontally add to the inside of a function

:math:`y = cos(x + h)` will have shifted the function left h.

Example:

.. image:: imgt/hshift-cosine.png

.. rubric:: Changing periods

To change the period multiply the inside by :math:`\frac{2\pi}{period}` like :math:`y = cos(b \cot x)`

The period of a function will be :math:`\frac{2\pi}{b}`.

Example:


.. image:: imgt/period-cosine.png


.. note::

    When determining period and shift always factor to isolate the x.

    For example: Change :math:`sin(5x + 5)` to :math:`sin(s(x + 1))` to find a horizontal shift of 1 and a period of :math:`\frac{2\pi}{5}`

Inverse Trig Functions
--------------------------

| :math:`sin^{-1}(\theta)` range: :math:`[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]`
| :math:`cos^{-1}(\theta)` range: :math:`[0, \pi]`

All output will be in this range.

.. rubric:: Finding other values

By finding the reference angle, you can find another value.

By finding a co-terminal angle, you can find an angle within range of the question

.. note::

    Finding other angles is only applicable for :math:`sin(x) = y`, not for :math:`sin^{-1}(y) = x`

.. rubric:: Inverse Equality

.. math::

    cos^{-1}(cos(x)) &= x \quad \text{Always} \\
    cos(cos^{-1}(x)) &= x \quad \text{Sometimes} 

Always do the later to check!!!


Law of Sines and Cosines
--------------------------

Law of Sines:

.. math::

    \frac{sin(A)}{a} = \frac{sin(B)}{b} = \frac{sin(C)}{c}

Law of Cosines:

.. math::

    c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cdot cos(C)

SSA
----------------------

Use the formula to find the hight:

.. math::

    h = sin(A) * b

.. image:: imgt/four-case.png

.. rubric:: Two Triangles

#. Use law of sines to find possible C
#. Since they are supplementary, :math:`180 - C` will get an alt C angle
#. Solve the triangle for both angles
