============================

Rates of change
---------------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Information

| 
| Rates of change is how much a function increases over a period of time.
| 
| Liner functions always have constant rate of change
| Can be described as :math:`\frac{rise}{run}`


.. rubric:: Calculating between points

.. math::

    \frac{rise}{run} = \frac{y_{1} - y_{2}}{x_{1} - x_{2}}


Input / Output and Domain and Range
-----------------------------------------

| A **function** is a where an input collates to an output. One input must have only one output. Often written in f(x) where x is the input and f(x) is the output.
| The **domain** of a function are all valid input values.
| The **range** of a function are all reachable outputs.

.. note:: 

    When a variable is stated to be a function of another variable it is the output. For example cost is a function of price would mean :math:`cost = f(price)`

.. rubric:: Evaluating functions

Just plug in the values.

.. math::

    f(x) &= 8x + 2 \\
    f(7) &= 8 \cdot 7 + 2 \\ 
    f(7) &= 58

.. rubric:: Testing functions by table

A function can only have one input per output.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - x
      - y

    * - 1
      - 4

    * - 7
      - 2

    * - 1
      - 6


Not a function due to having two values for one.


.. rubric:: Testing functions on a graph

By utilizing the vertical line test we can is if its a function.

.. drawio:: images/not-a-function.drawio

.. rubric:: Finding dormain Examples

.. math::

  f(x) = \sqrt{x-5}

By seeing that anything below 5 will make this invalid we can say the domain is :math:`x \ge 5`

.. math::

  f(x) = \frac{1}{x-5}

By seeing that 5 results in a divison by zero: :math:`x \neq 5`


.. math::

  f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x-5}}

By seeing that anything below 5 will make this invalid and by seeing that 5 results in a divison by zero: :math:`x > 5`




Piecewise
-----------------------------------------

| A **piecewise** function uses a diffrent forumular for diffrent dormain.


.. image:: images/piecewise.png


.. math::

  &= -\frac{1}{2} x + 7 \; x \le 3 \\
  &= 2 \; 3 < x \le 2 \\
  &= -2x + 17 \; x > 5
