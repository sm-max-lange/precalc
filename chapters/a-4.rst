Basic Exponential
-----------------------
| Exponential raise or fall by a constant percent
| Exponential increases/decreases by a common multiplier as opposed to a common difference.
| The basic exponential function takes the form of :math:`f(x) = ab^x` where a is the constant while b is the rate.

.. rubric:: Properties of b

| When :math:`b > 1`, the function is growing
| When :math:`0 < b < 1`, the function is decaying


.. rubric:: Calculating percent growth

To get the percent growth from the function, subtract b by one.

For example:

.. math::

    f(x) &= 5 \cdot 1.05^x \\
    r  &= 5 \%

Or for decay:

.. math::

    f(x) &= 5 \cdot 0.75^x \\
    r  &= -0.25 \%

.. rubric:: Creating a formula

To create the formula, add one to the rate.

Example:

An initial amount of 50 decreases 9% per year

.. math::

    b &= 1 + (-0.09) \\
    b &= 0.91 \\
    f(x) &= 50 \cdot 0.91^x


Finding Formula From Two Points (Basic)
-----------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Finding Formula From Two Points using y-int

When given y-int, simply plug that in to the b value and plug in the other points to solve.

For example:

.. image:: img4/y-int-basic-find.png

.. math::

    y &= 10 \cdot b^x \\
    20 &= 10 \cdot b^3 \\
    2 &= b^3 \\
    b &= \sqrt[3]{2} \\
    y &= 10 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{3}^{x}} \\
    y &= 10 \cdot 2^{\frac{x}{3}}


.. rubric:: Unitizing Shortcut formula 

Unitize this formula to calculate b
.. math::

    b^{x_{2} - x_{1}} = \frac{y_{2}}{y_{1}}

Graphing Exponential Functions
--------------------------------

1. Start with y-int
2. Find points
3. Connect points

.. rubric:: Domain and Range

| Domain: :math:`(-\infty, \infty)`
| Range: :math:`(0, \infty)`

.. rubric:: Shifts

| Shift up: :math:`y = b^x + a`
| Shift down: :math:`y = b^x - a`
| Shift left: :math:`y = b^{x-a}`
| Shift right: :math:`y = b^{x+a}`

Compound Interest 
-------------------

.. rubric:: Compound Interest Formula

.. math::

    A = P (1 + \frac{r}{n})

| P is the initial 
| r is nominal rate or the rate on paper. Also called annual percent rate (APR)
| n is the number of compounds per year

.. rubric:: Nominal v. Effective

| Nominal is what is given on paper.
| Effective is the accrual percentage gained after a year

Effective can be calculated from nominal using this formula:

.. math::

    (1+\frac{r}{n})^n


Euler Number
------------------

Continuous growth uses the constant e

.. rubric:: Continuous Growth Formula

.. math::

    f(t) = e^{kt}

k is a constant called that continuous rate.

.. rubric:: Behavior of k

| When k is negative, the function decreases
| When k is positive, the function increases


Log Basic Info
----------------
A log is the inverse of a exponential and thus the domain and range are flipped.

The definition of log:

If :math:`y = log_{b}(x)` than :math:`x = b^y`

.. rubric:: Log Properties

Product rule: :math:`log(ab) = log(a) + log(b)`
Quotient rule: :math:`log(\frac{a}{b}) = log(a) - log(b)`
Reciprocal rule: :math:`log(a^x) = x \cdot log(a)`
Log of base: :math:`log_{b}(b) = 1`
Change of base: :math:`log_{b}(a) = \frac{log(a)}{log(b)}`
