Sequence and Series
============================

Introduction
--------------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Vocab

| A **sequence** is a set of numbers that are related.
| A **finite sequence** has an end. 
| A **infinite sequence** has no end.
| The **recursive formula** is based on the previous terms.

.. math::

    a_{1} = imital value; a_{n} = m a_{n-1} + b

.. rubric:: Term Notation

* The first term in a sequence is denoted :math:`a_{1}` 
* Each subsequent term is denoted term :math:`a_{n}` (n = number in sequence)
    * Example: :math:`a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}`

| Dormain = Term
| Range = Term Value


Series
--------------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Vocab

| A **serries** is the sum of a sequence. An infinite sequence has no sum. It is equivalent to :math:`\infinite`
| A **partial sum** is the sum of a speffice number of terms.

Horray! No new formulas.
